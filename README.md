Pong Game in Python using Turtle Graphics
This repository contains a Python program that implements the classic game Pong using the Turtle graphics library. Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle and tries to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game features a graphical interface with a black background and colorful paddles and ball.
Game Controls
Player 1 (Right Paddle):

Move Up: Up Arrow Key
Move Down: Down Arrow Key
Player 2 (Left Paddle):

Move Up: 'W' Key
Move Down: 'S' Key
Game Rules
Each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen.
The ball starts in the center and moves towards one of the paddles.
The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it past the opponent's paddle.
If the ball hits the top or bottom wall, it bounces back.
If the ball hits a paddle, it bounces off in the opposite direction.
If the ball goes past a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
The game continues until one player reaches the maximum score or until you exit the game.
